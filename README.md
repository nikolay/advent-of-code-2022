# Advent of Code (2022)

This repository has my solutions for this year's Advent of Code contest. They may not be pretty or optimal, but although it's hard to beat Python in expressiveness and brevity, I still try to solve the problems as fast as I can in Go.

I only do minor code cleanup after obtaining the stars for the day and do not change the algorithm, regardless of how embarrassing it could be!
